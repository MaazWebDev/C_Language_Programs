This C program counts the number of characters you enter and displays the total after you signal EOF (End of File).

#include <stdio.h>
This includes the standard input-output library so we can use functions like getchar() and printf().

int main() {}

This is the main function, where the program starts running.
int means the function will return an integer value (0 for success).

    long nc;

Declares a variable nc of type long, which will store the character count.

    nc = 0;

Initializes nc to 0 because we haven't counted any characters yet.

    while (getchar() != EOF) {  

getchar() reads one character at a time from the user.
The loop runs until EOF (End of File) is detected.
On Windows, EOF is entered by pressing Ctrl + Z, then pressing Enter.

        ++nc;

Every time a character is read, nc increases by 1.

    }

The loop ends when EOF is detected.

printf("Total number of characters: %ld\n", nc);
After exiting the loop, the program prints the total character count
