This C program reads characters from the keyboard and prints them to the screen. Let's break it down step by step:

#include <stdio.h>
This line includes the standard input-output (stdio) library.
It allows the program to use functions like getchar() (to read input) and putchar() (to print output).

int main() {}

This is the main function, where the program starts running.
int means the function will return an integer value (0 for success).

    int c;

This declares a variable c of type integer.
It will store the characters that the user inputs.

    c = getchar();

The getchar() function reads one character from the keyboard.
The character is stored in the variable c.

    while (c != EOF) {}

This is a loop that runs as long as c is not EOF.
EOF (End Of File) is a special value that means "no more input" (usually typed as Ctrl + D on Linux/macOS or Ctrl + Z on Windows).

    putchar(c);

The putchar(c) function prints the character c on the screen.

    c = getchar();

Reads the next character from input.
This ensures that the loop keeps running and printing characters until the user enters EOF.

    return 0;
This indicates that the program has ended successfully.
