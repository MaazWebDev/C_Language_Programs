This C program prints "Hello World !" on the screen.

Step-by-step Breakdown
Include the standard input/output library:
#include <stdio.h>
This allows the program to use the printf function.

Start the main function:
int main(void)

The program starts executing from here.
Print "Hello ":

printf("Hello ");
This prints "Hello " (including a space after Hello).

Print "World !":

printf("World !");
This prints "World !" immediately after "Hello ".

Move to a new line:
printf("\n");
\n moves the cursor to a new line after printing "Hello World !".

Final Output
Hello World !
