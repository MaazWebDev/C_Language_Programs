This C program prints the text "Hello Maaz !\n" character by character using a while loop.

Step-by-step Explanation
Include the standard input/output library:

#include <stdio.h>
This allows the program to use the printf function.
Start the main function:

int main(void) 

void in main(void)

When you write: int main(void)
The void inside the parentheses means that the function does not take any arguments.
It tells the compiler that main does not expect any input when the program runs.

Correct Alternative:
You can also write int main() without void, and it will still work

The program starts running from here.
Declare and initialize variables:

int i = 0;
char *str = "Hello Maaz !\n";
i is an integer variable that starts at 0.
str is a pointer to a string containing "Hello Maaz !\n".
Loop through each character of the string:

while(str[i] != '\0') {
    printf("%c", str[i]);
    i++;
}
while(str[i] != '\0') → This loop runs until the null character \0 (which marks the end of a string).
printf("%c", str[i]); → Prints one character at a time.
i++ → Moves to the next character in the string.

Return statement:

return 0;
This tells the system that the program finished successfully.

Output
Hello Maaz !
