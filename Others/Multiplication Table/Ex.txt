This program takes a number as input from the user and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Include Standard Library

#include <stdio.h>
This includes the standard input-output library to use functions like printf() and scanf().

2. Start the main() Function

int main() {}
This is the starting point of the program.

3. Declare an Integer Variable

int num;
num will store the number entered by the user.

4. Ask the User for a Number

printf("Enter a number : ");
scanf("%d", &num);

Enter a number :
scanf("%d", &num); takes user input and stores it in num.

5. Print a Heading for the Table

printf("The Multiplication table of %d :\n", num);

If the user enters 5, it will print:

The Multiplication table of 5 :

6. Use a for Loop to Print the Table

for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf("%d * %d = %d\n", num, i, num * i);
}

This loop runs 10 times (i = 1 to 10).
Each time, it calculates and prints the multiplication result.
