This program counts the number of words in a sentence typed by the user. It assumes that words are separated by spaces.

Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Declare Variables

int c , count = 0;
c → Stores each character typed by the user.
count = 0 → Stores the number of spaces (' ') found in the input.

2. Read Input Character by Character

while((c = getchar()) != '\n' ){}

getchar() → Reads one character at a time from user input.
The loop continues until the user presses Enter ('\n').

3. Check for Spaces

if(c == ' '){
    count++;
}

Every time a space (' ') is found, count increases by 1.

Example:
Input: "hello world"
Space found → count = 1

4. Calculate the Number of Words

printf("%d\n" , count + 1);
The number of words is spaces + 1.

Example:

Input: "hello world maaz"
Spaces: 2
Words: 2 + 1 = 3

Why +1?

Every word is separated by a space
Words = spaces + 1
