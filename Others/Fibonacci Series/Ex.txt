This C program generates a Fibonacci series up to n terms. It asks the user to enter the number of terms and prints the sequence accordingly.

1. Include Standard Library

#include <stdio.h>

This includes the standard input-output library, so we can use functions like printf() and scanf().

2. Start the main() Function

int main() {}

This is the starting point of the program.

3. Declare Variables

int n, first = 0, second = 1, nextTerm;
n → Stores the number of terms entered by the user.
first = 0 → First Fibonacci number.
second = 1 → Second Fibonacci number.
nextTerm → Will store the next number in the sequence.

4. Take Input from the User

printf("Enter a number of terms : ");
scanf("%d", &n);
printf() asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate.
scanf("%d", &n); takes input and stores it in n.

5. Print the First Two Numbers

printf("Fibonacci Series : ");
printf("%d %d ", first, second);

The first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) are printed directly.
6. Use a for Loop to Generate the Series

for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    nextTerm = first + second;
    printf("%d ", nextTerm);
    first = second;
    second = nextTerm;
}

The loop runs n times to generate the next Fibonacci numbers.
Each new term is calculated as the sum of the previous two:

nextTerm = first + second;

first and second are then updated to move forward in the sequence.
