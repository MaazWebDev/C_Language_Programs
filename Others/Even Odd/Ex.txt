This C program checks whether a number is even or odd. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Header File (#include <stdio.h>)
This line includes the Standard Input-Output (stdio) library, which allows us to use functions like printf() and scanf() for input and output.

2. Main Function (int main())
This is the starting point of the program.

3. Declaring a Variable (int num;)
We declare an integer variable named num. This will store the number entered by the user.

4. Asking for User Input (printf() and scanf())

printf("Enter a number : ");
scanf("%d", &num);
printf() displays the message: "Enter a number : " so the user knows what to do.

scanf("%d", &num); takes input from the user and stores it in the num variable.

5. Checking Even or Odd (if-else Statement)

if(num % 2 == 0){
    printf("The number is even. %d\n", num);
}else{
    printf("The number is odd. %d\n", num);
}
num % 2 calculates the remainder when num is divided by 2.

If the remainder is 0, it means the number is even, so it prints:
"The number is even. [number]"

Otherwise, the number is odd, so it prints:
"The number is odd. [number]"

6. Returning 0 (return 0;)
This line tells the system that the program has successfully finished.

Example Output

Enter a number : 8
The number is even. 8
