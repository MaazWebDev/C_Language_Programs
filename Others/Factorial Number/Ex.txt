This program calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.

#include <stdio.h>
This includes the standard input-output library so we can use printf() and scanf() functions.

int main() {}

This is the main function, where the program starts running.

    int num;
    long long factorial = 1;

num: Stores the number entered by the user.
factorial: Stores the calculated factorial. We use long long because factorial values can be very large.

    printf("Enter a Number : ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

The program asks the user to enter a number.
scanf("%d", &num); takes input from the user and stores it in num.

    if(num < 0) {
        printf("Factorial of a negative number doesn't exist. \n");
    }
Checks if the number is negative.
If num is less than 0, it prints an error message because factorial is not defined for negative numbers.

    else {
        for(int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
            factorial = factorial * i;
        }

If the number is positive or zero, the program calculates the factorial using a for loop:

i = 1: Start from 1.
i <= num: Run the loop until num.
i++: Increase i by 1 in each loop.
factorial = factorial * i;: Multiply factorial by i in every loop.


        printf("Factorial of %d is %lld\n", num , factorial);
    }

Finally, it prints the factorial result.
%d → for num (integer).
%lld → for factorial (long long).
